### Description

A discussion of the social struggles that emerged in the second half of the 1960s in Italy which traversed the normal bounds of labor politics. These struggles developed largely in response to the differentiation of workers within the same firms, the intensification and extensification of the labor process, and the lack of suitable organizational models or labor representation that could develop the social power of workers.
