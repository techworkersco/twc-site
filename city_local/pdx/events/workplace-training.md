# PDX October 2019 Workplace Organizer Training

Tech Worker Organizer Training is a six hour class which aims to give people the minimum skills and knowledge to get started safely and responsibly with workplace organizing as tech workers (workers in the tech industry or technical workers in any industry).

While some tech workers, such as cafeteria workers at some tech companies, are unionized, the tech industry has far less exposure to unions and collective workplace action than other industries. This training centers organizing workers and workplaces where the question of unionization is in the distant future. An inability to turn to unions for support and entrenched lack of labor militancy bring up unique challenges for potential organizers, and this training aims to address some of them and to serve as a jumping off point for organizers to build support networks which can fill some of the holes left by lack of traditional unions.

Rather than relying on instruction, this training is focused around hands-on learning and discussion of actual workplace experiences. All trainers have experience organizing as tech workers, and can speak to their own unique experiences and how they map to lessons for others. Come prepared with your thoughts and ideas about your own workplace and with questions to ask the trainers!
