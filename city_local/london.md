# London Tech Workers Coalition

This is the London, UK, chapter of the TWC. We started organising in early
2019, and our first public meeting was at [Newspeak House](https://nwspk.com/)
in September 2019.

We now have regular monthly general meetings, usually on the first Wednesday of
the month at [MayDay Rooms](http://www.maydayrooms.org/). We also hold various
other meetings, learning clubs, and workers' inquiries, along with other
organising.

A calendar of all our upcoming public events is available
[here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=enk8hlrmu1dv15e4s2hf0lrbb0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).

Our definition of a "tech worker" is anyone involved in the tech industry in
any capacity &mdash; including programmers, designers, product managers,
students, gig workers (Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders etc.), and cleaners and
contractors at tech companies. All tech workers and allies are welcome to
attend any public TWC London meetings.
