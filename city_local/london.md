# London Tech Workers Coalition

This is the London, UK, chapter of the TWC. We started organising in early
2019, and our first public meeting was at [Newspeak House](https://nwspk.com/)
in September 2019, moving to [MayDay Rooms](http://www.maydayrooms.org/)
thereafter.

We now have regular monthly general meetings online, announced on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TechWorkersLDN) and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TechWorkersLDN), usually on the first
Wednesday on the month. We also hold various other meetings, learning clubs,
and workers' inquiries, along with other organising.

Our definition of a "tech worker" is anyone involved in the tech industry in
any capacity &mdash; including programmers, designers, product managers,
students, gig workers (Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders etc.), and cleaners and
contractors at tech companies. All tech workers and allies are welcome to
attend any public TWC London meetings.
