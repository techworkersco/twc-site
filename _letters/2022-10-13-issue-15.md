## The Worker's Perspective

It’s been a year in the making, with many decades of history before it, but our first teach-in starts next week. Today’s newsletter includes a few updates we want to share with you.

#### Why an intergenerational teach-in?

To imagine better futures, we look to history as a teacher. We as a collective believe that workers in tech are and have always been historical actors, but learning from history in tech – even the past few years –  is challenging. We also believe history shows that reforms have never been enough to unite workers across race and class and create a world where we can live with joy and self-determination. So, in this teach-in, we will celebrate our elders, gather wisdom from history, and use it to guide our future organizing.

#### Program and Schedule

We have a mix of 13 workshops and roundtables with 32 presenters, featuring many elders who have organized many decades ago, including:

* Dr. Richard Hudson, [IBM Black Workers Alliance](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/06/28/issue-14/)
* Marceline Donaldson, [IBM Black Workers Alliance](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/06/28/issue-14/)
* Joan Greenbaum, [Computer People for Peace](https://theoutline.com/post/4029/computer-people-for-peace-history)
* Caroline Hunter, [Polaroid Revolutionary Workers Movement](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/06/30/polaroid-worker-who-protested-companys-ties-to-apartheid-south-africa-reflects-on-wayfair-walkout)
* Phil Asquith, [The Lucas Plan](http://lucasplan.org.uk/story-of-the-lucas-plan/)
* David Bacon, [workers organizing at National Semiconductor](https://truthout.org/articles/up-against-the-open-shop-the-hidden-story-of-silicon-valley-s-high-tech-workers-2/)

#### Registration
 
For a positive and lasting experience at the teach-in, we recommend people invite friends and friendly coworkers to form groups and attend together. You can join the full event, or specific sessions. Sign up at [twcteachin.org/program](https://twcteachin.org/program).
 
#### Event Accessibility Fund

Inequality is growing in and around tech, but mutual aid unites us across race, class, & workplaces. That's why we set up a fund for our teach-in. The event is free, but we realize people have financial needs related to taking time to attend a 3-day event (lost wages from missing work, child care, etc.). People can request up to $500, no questions asked. Our goal is to collect $15,000 to cover mutual aid requests and event accessibility costs, and as of today the fund has about $6,000. If you need funds to attend, register for the teach-in and we’ll follow-up. And if you have the means to help fellow workers attend, please consider a suggested donation of $50–500 to [our Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/twc-teachin).

See you at the teach-in! For questions or ideas, email [twcteachin@protonmail.com](mailto:twcteachin@protonmail.com).
