### Worker's Perspective

Our movement is growing stronger by the day! [Over 100,000 people have signed petitions](http://100,000%20signed%20letter%C2%A0https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/07/03/100000-people-call-microsoft-and-other-tech-companies-drop-contracts-ice-and) calling on the major tech companies to drop their contracts with ICE and Customs & Border Patrol. We need to keep turning up the pressure internally -- the public is beginning to stand up behind us!  
  
Last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff [rejected the demands](https://twitter.com/salesforce/status/1012035908722397184) of over 700 employees, who had [signed an internal petition](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/salesforce-employees-push-back-against-company-contract?utm_term=.yd11ByaK8#.xfRA9jgBp) to cancel the company's contract with CBP. But the fight isn't over yet.&nbsp;  
  
**[This coming Monday, there will be a rally at Salesforce HQ in San Francisco](https://www.facebook.com/events/193808551309092/)**, calling upon the company to "Cancel the CBP Contract!" Together we will take to the streets, sending a strong message to our fellow tech workers at Salesforce: We are with you, we support you, and we will not back down!

From the official press release:  

> On Monday, July 9th 2018 at 10:00AM, please join The San Francisco Progressive Alliance and allied organizations and individuals for a press conference outside of 415 Mission St (Salesforce Tower), where we will formally denounce the company’s continued engagement with agencies that perpetuate human rights abuse.
>
> We stand in support of Salesforce employees and the marginalized populations that continue to be targeted for abuse by CBP. We demand that Salesforce’s contract with CBP be canceled, and that a plan be implemented to evaluate the ethical impact of all current and future Salesforce products.

**More updates on the global fight to end family separation and #AbolishICE:**

In Washington, D.C., actress Susan Sarandon, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and over 500 other women demonstrators were [arrested in a mass demonstration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/we-will-not-obey-hundreds-of-women-rally-in-dc-to-protest-zero-tolerance-immigration-policy/2018/06/28/d1aca604-7a4a-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.46f0c5c7dfec) at the Hart Senate Office Building as they called for the abolition of ICE.&nbsp;  
  
It seems that [even some ICE agents now believe](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/ice-immigration-eliminate-agency.html) that their organization has exceeded its mandate under the Trump administration. Recently, at least 19 ICE investigators signed a letter to Kirstjen Nielsen asking to dissolve the agency (but naturally, they want a new one to take its place...).&nbsp;  
  
The #OccupyICE movement has [expanded to protest camps and blockades of ICE offices](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/03/occupy-ice-protests-immigration-families) across the country. Turn out wherever people are organizing near you; in San Francisco meet at&nbsp;444 Washington Street at 12 pm tomorrow, and follow @OCCUPLYICESF for updates.  
  
_“We will be here as long as we can,” said Imri Rivas, a 25-year-old camped outside a San Francisco Ice building on Tuesday. “What’s important for me is the active disruption of ICE operations. I hope people do it everywhere.”_  
  
Our immigration fight is going global. Some [European countries are now using smartphone data to deport refugees](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/europe-immigration-refugees-smartphone-metadata-deportations). The technologies that we work on and design are often being turned against their users. Let's mobilize our European colleagues!&nbsp;

He recalls walking away from negotiations with a newly hired employee thinking, 'Man, this guy is underpaid—we got a good deal.'"

### Song Of The Week

### **[Tracy Chapman - "Talkin' About A Revolution" (Official Music Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv8FBjo1Y8I)**
  
_While they're standing in the welfare lines / Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation / Wasting time in unemployment lines / Sitting around waiting for a promotion / Don't you know you're talking about a revolution / It sounds like a whisper_
