Workers are holding DoorDash accountable for a dishonest tipping policy that shortchanges drivers and puts more money in management's pockets.

In an open letter published today ([instructions for signing here](https://medium.com/@anna.geiduschek/an-open-letter-from-tech-workers-to-doordash-dc387fdef0fe)), signers demonstrate solidarity with drivers and workers who are bringing attention to DoorDash's wage theft practices. The letter's demands&nbsp;include a $15 per hour pay floor for all drivers, plus tips.

###  Organizing Tip Of The Week

**THERE'S PROBLEMS AT WORK; WHERE DO I START TO ADDRESS THEM?**  
  
The answer is always “talk to your trusted coworkers”! (And never “talk to your manager”). Find people that will either support you and have your back, or others who have&nbsp;aligned interests. Look to strength in numbers for addressing any grievance.
