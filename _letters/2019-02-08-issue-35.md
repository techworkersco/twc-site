[Waheed Etimad was working full time as an Uber driver to support his spouse and seven children](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/02/04/us/ap-us-highway-crash-father-killed.html). He migrated here with his family four years ago and he was studying to become a computer engineer. He was killed while working on Sunday night. Uber will pay no workers comp death benefits for his family. There will be no life insurance pay out. In life, Waheed was a unit of profit for Uber. In death, he is nothing to them.&nbsp;

On Monday night drivers held a vigil in Waheed's memory, and then drove in procession&nbsp;to Uber HQ. They asked for #JusticeForWaheed, and whether Uber would do anything to&nbsp;support his family after profiting from his labor. Uber is liable for nothing. This is the lie the entire gig economy rests on: that as contractors are not beholden to their employers, so employers are not beholden to them.

### Organizing Tip Of The Week

**DON'T CALL A MASS MEETING**  
  
When something big happens that gets people agitated, it can be tempting to try and harness that energy by calling a big meeting to start organizing people to fight it. However, that can end up painting a target on your back, and when management starts leaning on everyone who spoke up, you can find that your base of support seems to vanish before your eyes. A better plan is to make notes of who's upset and who's affected, and to try to set up one-on-one meetings outside of work to get to know their experiences better. Remember the 80/20 rule&mdash;in a one-on-one, as an organizer you want to listen 80% of the time.

[**Instacart shopper-workers claimed victory this week**](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/after-scrutiny-instacart-will-end-its-controversial-tipping) in reversing a tipping policy in which management dipped into tips to subsidize customers' $10 delivery minimum; see the [petition that helped fuel their campaign here](https://medium.com/@workingwa/instacart-heres-our-22-cents-no-more-tip-theft-low-pay-and-black-box-pay-algorithms-8ff1d7c6b66).&nbsp;Amid celebration, workers at Instacart and elsewhere continue to organize to fight for greater transparency into the algorithms directing their work and wages.

[**Amazon has denied any coordination of the anti-union tweets**](https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/nyc-hq2-amazon-fulfillment-center-union-tweets.html) of its fulfillment-center "social media ambassadors" despite the tweet's character-by-character similarity. (Amazon used the same tactic on social media last summer.)&nbsp;

"In their essay on the Californian Ideology, Barbrook and Cameron described the people who worked in Silicon Valley as 'digital artisans.'&nbsp;Today they are more likely to be called 'entrepreneurs'&nbsp;or 'creatives,'&nbsp;but the idea remains the same: engineers, designers, and product managers are driven by passion and purpose. As Steve Jobs exhorted them, they do what they love. [**Lately, however, this cohort has begun to talk about themselves in a different way, as 'tech workers'—the term challenges the Californian Ideology at several levels**](https://newrepublic.com/article/153046/stark-political-divide-tech-ceos-employees?fbclid=IwAR23vbYuBm0zSRBSmhhqh3DH4xzl4E0dUQGf9YyUbFc3OKHJyRuqpLUC7w8). As we usually understand them, workers are not 'creatives,'&nbsp;inspired by a higher calling. Most people are workers by necessity, and sell their labor to make a living. By calling themselves workers, members of the new movement are staking a claim to this common identity."

### Song Of The Week

#### [**"No More" - The Lumpen (1970 "Seize The Time" Black Panther Party Productions)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVo29ejD7jA)

_From Watts, to Brownsville, we find misery,_  
_But there won't be no more, won't be no more,_  
_Rats, dirt, and kids who are hungry,_  
_There won't be no more, won't be no more,_  
_Cause we've seen, how to be free,_  
_Of pigs in our streets, and poverty,_  

_To this way of life, we're closing the door,_  
_So there won't be no more, won't be no more._
