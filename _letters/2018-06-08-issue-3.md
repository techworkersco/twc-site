###  Workers Perspective

**Jacobin Gets The Inside Scoop on How Google Workers Organized to Stop Project Maven**  
  
Last Friday, Google [announced](https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620) that it will not renew its contract with the US military for Project Maven.&nbsp; In a [revealing interview](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/06/google-project-maven-military-tech-workers), an anonymous Googler shared what went down inside the company as workers organized to halt the project. It's a riveting&nbsp;read, full of powerful insights as workers elsewhere begin to take up the mantle. From the interview:
  
_Sometimes, with organizing, you don’t see how close you are to winning something until it happens. Our campaign had been going on for months, and it didn’t feel like we were making much progress. Then all of a sudden we got this huge concession._

_The success of the campaign shows that when we stick together, we get more done than when we go it alone. We have to keep building a voice for workers based on mutual trust and aid. We have to continue building relationships not just at Google but across the industry and with other groups as well, like ICRAC, Tech Workers Coalition, and Coworker.org. We also need to reach out to the users of our technologies and build bonds of mutual interest with them._

_One response we heard a lot during the Project Maven campaign was, “If we don’t build it, someone else will.” But when tech workers stand up at one company and refuse to build something, it empowers workers at other companies to stand up and do the same. **When we show our power in one workplace, it helps other workers show their power in another.**_

### Song Of The Week

**Elaine Brown - The End of Silence**
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC-JbT9ic7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MkRuV0aCcI)  

Have you ever hoped that  
A time would come  
When your voice could be heard  
In a noon-day sun  
Have you waited so long  
'Til your unheard song  
Has stripped away your very soul
