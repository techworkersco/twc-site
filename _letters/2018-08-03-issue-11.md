This week we celebrate steps forward in our collective workers' struggle:

On Monday, workers from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies joined security guards at the negotiating table, amplifying their demands for a better contract. While the **[median salary at Facebook is $240,000 a year, a Silicon Valley security guard typically earns between $13 and $18 per hour, or $27,000 to $37,000 a year](https://gizmodo.com/google-and-facebooks-security-guards-are-fighting-to-ea-1826104897)**

<!--excerpt-->
  
Security guards shouldn't have to struggle to survive. They shouldn't have to come in to work sick or live out of their cars, especially not when they put their lives on the line every single day to make our workplaces safer.  
  
‚ÄúTech companies should already be at the table negotiating with us, in a sane world,‚Äù said Eric Murphy, a security officer who works at Facebook. ‚ÄúTheir intentional denial of the responsibility they have for their own employees is the root of the problem. They outsource the delay tactics and workplace issues so it doesn‚Äôt look bad for them.‚Äù

And on Tuesday, **[as protesters around the country called on tech companies to #CancelTheContract](https://gizmodo.com/six-arrested-at-amazon-store-amid-anti-ice-protest-in-n-1828014359)**, we joined approximately 50 protesters outside of Palantir's Palo Alto office to bring attention to the ways that **[their secretive surveillance tech fuels the ICE detention machine](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/palantir-ice-contract-protest)**. (**[VIDEO](http://abc7news.com/politics/palo-alto-ice-contractor-targeted-for-protest/3857029/)**)  
  
**[One protester put it in simple terms](https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2018/07/31/18816673.php)**: "We demand an end to this inhumanity. Palantir is building the tools of digital fascism being used by the Trump administration to harass, incarcerate and deport immigrants."

###  In The News

[**Facebook claimed to Congress that it had "identified a political influence campaign that was potentially built to disrupt the midterm elections**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/politics/facebook-political-campaign-midterms.html)." However, critics claim that [Facebook, aided by the media, has been given a free pass to shut down the pages of left-wing activists.](http://inthesetimes.com/article/21352/facebook_russia_antifascist-organizing-activism-media-donald-trump)  
  
[**Sandy Hook parents wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg demanding the company make a better effort to remove conspiracy theories and fake news**](https://www.indy100.com/article/sandy-hook-parents-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-shooting-open-letter-8464491):&nbsp;"While you implied that Facebook would act more quickly to take down harassment directed at Sandy Hook victims than, say, the posts of Holocaust deniers, that is not our experience. In fact, you went on to suggest that this type of content would continue to be protected and that your idea for combating incendiary content as to provide counterpoints to push ‚Äòfake news‚Äô lower in search results. Of course, this provides no protection to us at all."  
  
According to internal documents leaked to The Intercept, [**Google may soon re-launch its search engine ‚Äî with heavy censorship ‚Äî in China**](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/).  
  
A reminder that [**the way employers treat contractors today is how we will all be treated tomorrow, once our skills are no longer in demand**](https://notesfrombelow.org/article/organising-silicon-valleys-shadow-workforce).  
  
Creator of the Facebook game Battle Pirates, [**Kixeye, has outsourced its customer support to players of the game**](https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/27/kixeye-enlists-players-to-provide-customer-support-for-battle-pirates/?utm_content=bufferad6cf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) in what its Chief Marketing Officer calls an invaluable "gamification of our game". Support-rep-players are compensated with virtual currency from the game.  
  
[**Amazon affirms its commitment to build tech for war**](https://theintercept.com/2018/07/30/amazon-facial-recognition-police-military/): "We are unwaveringly in support of our law enforcement, defense, and intelligence community.‚Äù  
  
More details emerge on [**ways Amazon fosters a hostile environment to torture and control its workers**](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/amazon-warehouse-theft).  
  
How [**stock buybacks screw workers and keep wages stagnant**](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/07/are-stock-buybacks-starving-the-economy/566387/?utm_source=twb). "Workers around the country have been pushing for higher wages, but the answer is always, ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt afford it. We‚Äôd have to do layoffs or raise prices. That is just not true. The money is there. It‚Äôs just getting siphoned out of the company instead of reinvested into it.‚Äù  
  
[**The city of Philadelphia dropped its contract with ICE**](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/ice-immigration-data-philadelphia-pars-contract-jim-kenney-protest-20180727.html).  
  
Last Thursday, [**10,000 Disneyland workers won a three-year contract that raises wages 20% now&nbsp;and an additional 13% in January**](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney-contract-vote-20180726-story.html) following a months-long labor dispute.&nbsp;

In a debate that directly mirrors the tech industry, [**architects are asking whether making "improvements" to ICE detention centers is sufficient, versus boycotting the work entirely**](https://www.citylab.com/design/2018/07/should-designers-try-to-reform-immigrant-detention/565439/).&nbsp;"Belief in the power of 'design thinking' tells us that our buildings and spaces might have some positive effect on politics and the economy, and helps us find meaning in a profession where we work too long for too little. It‚Äôs a nice narrative, but it obfuscates the simple truth that politics is about power... Our task is to realize that the power that we do have is not as designers, but as architectural workers who are necessary to the functioning of the construction industry. Individual refusal on ethical grounds is a great start, but it is only through building a critical mass of people who refuse together that we can pressure our professional organizations, employers, and politicians not to accept the status quo." ‚úäüèæ

### Song Of The Week

### **[Gillian Welch Everything Is Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uePsL2ulb3M)&nbsp;(2001)**
  
_Everything is free now_<br/>
_That's what they say_<br/>
_Everything I ever done_<br/>
_Gotta give it away_<br/>
_Someone hit the big score_<br/>
_They figured it out_<br/>
_That we're gonna do it anyway_<br/>
_Even if doesn't pay_<br/>

_I can get a tip jar_<br/>
_Gas up the car_<br/>
_And try to make a little change_<br/>
_Down at the bar_<br/>

_Or I can get a straight job_<br/>
_I've done it before_<br/>
_I never minded working hard_<br/>
_It's who I'm working for_<br/>
