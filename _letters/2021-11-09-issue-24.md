Last week, Sharon Goen of [Gig Workers Collective](https://twitter.com/GigWC) in Las Vegas told her story and presented [five demands to fix on-demand shopping](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/11/02/issue-23/). This week, a former Instacart worker on the corporate side of the company wrote a song with their band The Strange Ones in support of GWC. The band is matching all sales in a donation to GWC until the end of today. Buy it on Bandcamp [here](https://wearethestrangeones.bandcamp.com/track/inside-out).

We applaud workers expressing solidarity in song, across company lines! 

If you know anyone who works on the corporate side of Instacart, send them [Sharon's story about going on strike](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/11/02/issue-23/); it’s free advice from shoppers for the company to make things right. 

[One tweet](https://twitter.com/yindithey/status/1455909561697591299) put it best: "Even if just one or two @instacartdesign folks stood up in favor of the shoppers, half of their demands could be met!"
