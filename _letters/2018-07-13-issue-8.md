It that's time of year again! If you're one of the millions of Americans who “celebrate” Amazon Prime Day (July 16-17) with a shopping spree, Amazon workers in Spain have a message for you: **Shut it down.**

<!--excerpt-->

Unions in Spain are calling on [Amazon workers from around the globe to join their strike and for customers to boycott the website](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/amazon-prime-day-2018-strike-deals-uk-sales-latest-a8441726.html), especially on Prime Day. As the striking workers put it themselves: “[We in Madrid believe that only if we struggle together will we gain recognition for our demands.](https://amazonenlucha.wordpress.com/2018/05/16/llamiento-a-una-huelga-europea-frente-a-amazon/)”  
  
**Here in the States, the fight against Amazon and its contracts with ICE has escalated.** Six activists with the immigrant rights group Cosecha were [arrested after blocking the entrance to the New York City Amazon Store](http://www.lahuelga.com/amazon-pressrelease). “I cannot be a bystander as Amazon facilitates the criminalization of my immigrant community,” said one Cosecha organizer, Cata Santiago. We stand with these activists and with the Amazon employees who refuse to help their company violate human rights.

On Monday, [Orlando Police confirmed that they are renewing their contract with Amazon for its Rekognition face recognition software](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-and-orlando-cops-controversial-face-recognition-1827483145%20). Amazon workers: you know what to do.&nbsp;  
  
And if you don't work at Amazon, you can still [take a stand against Amazon's pernicious labor and governance practices in local communities across the country](https://ilsr.org/amazon-next-frontier-action-sheet/%20).&nbsp;  
  
Finally, a reminder that our collective voices as workers are making a difference across industries: [After pressure from their employees, consulting firm **McKinsey & Company announced that it has stopped working with ICE**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/mckinsey-ends-ice-contract.html); [Deloitte may follow suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/business/deloitte-ice-contract-uproar.html) as pressure form internal employees mounts there as well.
