After years of working multiple jobs and putting their lives on the line just to make ends meet, Silicon Valley security guards have finally won a union contract.

<!--excerpt-->

“We began this organizing effort because officers in Silicon Valley were really struggling, some of us were homeless, and many of us were living on the edge and...working more than 40 hours a week,” Elizabeth, a Silicon Valley security officer and bargaining committee member, said in a statement.  
  
“Silicon Valley is one of the wealthiest places in the world, and the most expensive. We need to keep fighting to improve our situation so that we can live life with some safety and dignity.”  
  
While the union contract is a huge win for the security officers, it still lacks some of the protections they were fighting for.  
  
We need to continue to organize and build power across job classifications - security officers, programmers, all of us. That's the only way we can win.

We learned [this week](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/google-dragonfly-maven-employee-protest-demands) that over 1,400 Googlers signed a letter demanding the following changes from management:

1. An ethics review structure that includes rank and file employee representatives;
2. The appointment of ombudspeople with meaningful employee involvement in&nbsp;their selection;
3. A clear plan for transparency sufficient to enable Googlers an individual ethical choice about what they work on; and
4. The publication of “ethical test cases”; an ethical assessment of Dragonfly, Maven, and Airgap GCP with respect to the AI principles; and regular, official, internally visible communication and assessments regarding any new areas of substantial ethical concern.

These demands come in response to [news reports](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/) that Google has been planning to launch a censored search engine in China, internal code name "Dragonfly," along with the company's earlier decision to develop AI drone surveillance software for the Department of Defense under&nbsp;"[Project Maven](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html)." Among other concerning revelations, the [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html) that "Dragonfly" would censor air pollution information. This is the result of a continued lack of transparency and worker input, even in a company that claims to "not be evil."  
  
At a company-wide meeting on Thursday, execs reportedly told staff the product was at an "[exploratory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-17/google-ceo-is-said-to-tell-staff-china-plans-are-exploratory)" phase and declined to address the asks the workers made in the above letter.  
  
The only way we build power is by continuing to organize. We send our&nbsp;support to workers inside Google who are holding their bosses accountable.

[A former Google exec disclosed algorithmic bias in facial recognition software](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cloud-videoconferencing-system-bias-2018-8) that kept Black faces from being recognized in video conference software. We're not surprised by these disparities, which only reflect the lack of diversity in the design room. But tweaking an algorithm will do nothing to&nbsp; answer the real problem of systemic anti-Black racism.
