In 2016, Silicon Valley tech company cafeterias employed only 65 unionized workers. Two years and countless hours of organizing effort later,&nbsp;1,400 of Silicon Valley's cafeteria workers have union representation. On Monday night, we gathered in San Francisco to hear stories of that work from&nbsp;the women who lead the campaigns.

Some of them had&nbsp;worked in the cafeterias of Intel, Cal State East Bay, Nvidia&nbsp;for years before they were organized. The abuses they experienced ranged from psychological bullying&nbsp;and sexual harassment to&nbsp;being coerced into working 70 hour weeks at the threat of losing their jobs. We talked about the "what the hell do I have to lose" feeling ‚Äî the desperation that is a precondition for taking action to make change. We also talked about the equally important realization that you're not the only one who is struggling.&nbsp;Moving from feeling that you're isolated, to knowing that your co-worker leaves work crying in her car every day, just like you.

The cafeteria workers shared that they wanted to lend support to tech workers who were also building collective power at their companies. For them, it was often tempting to write off tech workers as "snobby rich kids" who don't care. But this perception changed when certain tech workers began to reach out to start friendships with the cafeteria workers, and later even showed up to the bargaining table to help negotiate a contract with management. As one of them told us on Monday night, "The company tries to divide us. They tell us that the engineers don't want us to form a union, that the engineers hate us. So it made&nbsp;a big difference when you'd say hello, when we could form a friendship. I see we are the same. If you cut our arms we bleed the same color."&nbsp;

These heroes&nbsp;challenged us to make our relationships with one another real ‚Äî that our relationships with our coworkers are the most important foundation for organizing. Everyone is going through something, they said. When we share with each other what we're struggling with, we will stick together. Knowing what's real will keep us together.

They encouraged us to keep going, not to give up. "Its going to be hard but you can do it."&nbsp;
