On Labor Day, we celebrated the milestone of five local chapters building worker power on the West Coast: San Francisco, South Bay, Seattle, San Diego, and Los Angeles!

<!--excerpt-->

{% include post_image.html %}

TWC is about creating solidarity through exploring, articulating, and acting upon our interests as workers. Together, we continue to experiment with future forms of worker collectivity — forms derived both from the ways capitalism has organized us and also how we organize against it.  
  
The issues and challenges facing tech workers vary within the local context. We're excited to share more stories and updates from the tech industry outside the Bay Area in the coming weeks.

### History's Highlight

IN THE SUMMER OF 1949, Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, and a massive influence on the theoretical development of automation technologies, wrote a letter to Walter Reuther, the President of the United Auto Workers (UAW). Wiener revealed that “one of the leading industrial corporations” of the United States wanted to enlist him in developing automatic control systems for their production lines, and that he had refused. He went on to argue that organized labor should take the prospect of automation seriously, and that they should try to get ahead of the trend either by: 1) developing automation technology while retaining ownership and profit more equally shared among workers, or 2) blocking the development of automation altogether. Wiener pledged his unconditional support to&nbsp;whichever path the UAW chose to pursue. _([Read more](https://libcom.org/history/father-cybernetics-norbert-wieners-letter-uaw-president-walter-reuther).)_
