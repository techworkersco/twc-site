We're focusing on talking with fellow workers and featuring the worker's perspective. But to do this effectively and with more care, we'd like to know:

How are we doing? And more importantly, how are _you_ doing?

We’re curious what you think we should do more, less, or the same. We’d love to hear about your work situation and other context for your feedback. Email us at twcnewsletter@protonmail.com.
