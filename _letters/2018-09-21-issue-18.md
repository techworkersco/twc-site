"A sales representative using Cresta's product got a sudden nosebleed while on the clock sending chat messages to customers, but was able to continue her work unimpeded. While ebbing the bleeding with one hand, she could click Cresta's conversational suggestions with the other."&nbsp; Founder Sebastian Thrun, formerly of Udacity, said that while "an employee working through the loss of vital fluids may seem bleak, it illustrates the product's value. If we train AI to take over boring repetitive tasks, we can free humanity and reach new heights." Whose humanity will be freed by this?

### History's Highlight

In 1970, a socialist government was elected to power in Chile.The next year, the government launched [Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn), an ambitious plan to use telecommunications technology to help manage and regulate a planned economy along socialist lines.  
  
The project was intended to collect data from nationalized factories, use the data to run simulations of the economy, and recommend real-time changes. Workers were empowered to make decisions about their workplaces through participatory design frameworks, including rank-and-file points of control in factory operations rooms.&nbsp;  
  
The system saw two years of development and experimentation before it was destroyed during the US-backed military coup's overthrow of Chile‚Äôs democracy on September 11th, 1973.
