[**100 women marched 100 miles to the California capitol&nbsp;in support of Assembly Bill 2079,&nbsp;the Janitor Survivor Empowerment Act**](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/13/from-abuse-to-activism-janitors-march-to-the-capitol-in-support-of-anti-harassment-bill/), which would put in place greater protections against sexual assault on the job for janitors. They started yesterday and arrived this morning.

It’s often easy to forget that the rank-and-file worker — the person whose work and presence is both indispensable and invisible to most of us — is still out there fighting every single day.

Yesterday, 100 of them reminded us — and lawmakers in Sacramento — that they’re not only tired of being taken advantage of, they’re also a political force to be reckoned with.

The bill goes beyond conventional anti-sexual harassment training and focuses instead on peer-to-peer solutions for survivors of industry abuse. Examples include sessions for workers to learn how to exercise their rights after instances of harassment.

“This is another huge step toward what we really want, which is our voices to be heard and respected,” said Joanna Ruiz, a college student and march participant whose parents are both janitors. “We want people in our community who still live in fear to know that we’re with them and speaking out for them.”
