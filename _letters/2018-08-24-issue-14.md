Tech bosses subcontract swaths of labor so they can defer responsibility when workers demand more security and less precarity. For the first time in its&nbsp;history, Google&nbsp;[now employs more contractors than full time employees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-23/microsoft-bug-testers-unionized-then-they-were-dismissed).

### Worker's Perspective

Tech bosses subcontract swaths of labor so they can defer responsibility when workers demand more security and less precarity. For the first time in its&nbsp;history, Google&nbsp;[now employs more contractors than full time employees](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-23/microsoft-bug-testers-unionized-then-they-were-dismissed).  
  
The last few years&nbsp;made us wiser; it’s time for this trend to end. We know that when workers who are subcontracted at our tech campuses try to organize, tech bosses are really the ones being brought to the table.  
  
When Microsoft bug testers contracted through Lionbridge successfully unionized they were eventually terminated. That was 2016. Since then we’ve logged victory after victory when our community stands together: Cafeteria workers won a union, security guards improved their contract, Google dropped Maven, and workers are drawing the line on contracts with ICE.  
  
The difference between 2016 and today is now we have a strong and growing network of workers around the country. We’re in conversation with each other, across roles, verticals and skill sets. We’re strengthening our collective voice and taking action to speak truth to power and speak out against exploitation.  
  
And remember: we are only getting started. Take the time to get to know your co-workers, listen to where they are coming from and the challenges they face. Through strong relationships, and by standing together, we can improve the lot of all workers.

[**We spend a lot time discussing whether the tech platforms are biased towards conservatives or liberals, the reality is they are biased towards one thing: profit**](https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/twitter-facebook-alex-jones-bias.html). For years YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have known about bullying and hate on their sites, and instead of hiring sufficient numbers of people to moderate, they've wished the problem away. They'll tell us that AI will save us, and that they could never possibly hire enough people to moderate. However, in the same way traditional companies hire people to work in customer service, big tech should also staff up appropriately.  
  
Amazon's desperate&nbsp;[**Twitter-blitz marketing campaign says it's all smiles for warehouse workers**](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/what-is-this-weird-twitter-army-of-amazon-drones-cheerfully-defending-warehouse-work/).&nbsp;Staff were given gift cards, days off and other incentives to say positive things about working at Amazon. "FC ambassadors" (short for "fulfillment center ambassadors") have been mobilized with tweet scripts to [assuage anxious consumers about their freedom to use the toilet, and that they don't have to rely on food stamps](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/23/amazon-fc-ambassadors-twitter-working-conditions).

[**Data-throttling by Verizon slowed Santa Clara County fire response**](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/). Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement that Verizon's throttling "actively impeded County Fire's ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services." The statement will be included as evidence in a lawsuit seeking to reinstate net neutrality.
