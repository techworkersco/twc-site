As fellow workers in the tech industry, we are acutely aware of the exploitative conditions that so-called “contractor” rideshare drivers are exposed to and their struggle to make ends meet. We see Monday’s impressive strike of Uber and Lyft drivers as a necessary step in this struggle for equitable conditions.&nbsp;Therefore we offer total solidarity and support for their cause.

<!--excerpt-->

We are excited to see the&nbsp;[call](https://onezero.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-uber-we-need-to-do-right-by-our-drivers-81453fad41e1)&nbsp;for full-time workers of Uber and Lyft to keep organizing alongside their driver colleagues and amplify the drivers' cause. We commend their recognition that the division between drivers and full-time tech workers is false. Tech workers and drivers share a commonality; there is continuity between the exploitation of rideshare drivers and the harassment and abuse Uber full-time workers&nbsp;have revealed.

We join in their demand for fair treatment and the recognition of drivers as full-time employees with the security and benefits such recognition brings, as is outlined in the&nbsp;[Dynamex decision](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/companies-may-need-to-rethink-gig-economy-after-court-ruling). We call on tech workers everywhere to challenge the narratives that justify putting profit above well-being and dignity for all people. TWC is here for you and will help you get started.

This TWC statement was [posted on Wednesday](https://medium.com/@techworkersco_79433/in-solidarity-with-drivers-united-and-drivers-everywhere-fighting-for-dignity-42c0f58b9c35) in support of a letter written by Uber workers calling for support of Monday's strike and a rejection of&nbsp;"the two-tiered division of labor that denies drivers the basic workers’ rights afforded to internal employees". Hundreds of drivers went on&nbsp;[strike](https://gizmodo.com/hundreds-turn-out-to-picket-against-uber-amid-25-hour-d-1833553483)&nbsp;in LA and SF on Monday, listing demands that included:&nbsp;guaranteed minimum pay (similar to what New York recently voted to enact), a 10-percent commission cap for the employers, and an end to driver deactivations without just cause.

As Lyft prepares to IPO today, drivers continue to protest&nbsp;outside of Lyft HQ. [**Follow their progress here**](https://www.facebook.com/GigWorkersRising/).

### Organizing Tip Of The Week

 **ALWAYS KEEP CHECKING IN**  
  
Some of you may already have built a budding organizing committee (OC): one that meets regularly, assigns and completes tasks, and develops short and long term strategies for building power in the workplace. As you continue to develop and grow, it may seem like further one on ones only need to occur between OC members and coworkers that you're hoping will get involved. While that never stops being important, checking in with others on the organizing committee is just as valuable. Many organizers have had experiences where one on ones with other OC members revealed concerns and fears that they did not feel comfortable sharing in a broader meeting, for example. Organizing is also exhausting work, and building a culture of caring for your fellow organizers can make or break campaigns when the going gets rough. Take care of one another so you can fight the boss together.

###  Song Of The Week

#### [le tigre - get off the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsXcocZXGsA)

_It feels so 80's_  
_Or early 90's_  
_To be political_  
_Where are my friends?_  

_I'll meet u in the street_  
_(Get off the internet)_  
_Destroy the right wing_  
_(Get off the internet)_  
_I'll meet u in the street_  
_(Get off the internet)_  
_Destroy the right wing_  

_This is repetitive_  
_But nothing has changed_  
_And I'm crazy_  
_Where are my friends?_
