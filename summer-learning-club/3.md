# Organizing High-Tech Workers
**Saturday, August 05, 2017, 4PM-6PM**

### Description

There is historical precedence for organizing workers in the tech industry -- both blue-collar production workers and white-collar engineers and programmers. We will examine some of this history, and discuss what lessons we can take away, and how to apply them to current efforts.
