## Meet the Tech Workers Coalition

We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends. We are organizing for activism, civic engagement and education in the Bay Area. We work in solidarity with existing movements towards social justice, workers rights, and economic inclusion.

### How We Work

You are welcome to check us out at our [monthly organization meeting in San Francisco](https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Workers-Coalition/).
