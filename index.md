  <p>Guided by our vision for an inclusive & equitable tech industry, TWC organizes to build worker power through rank & file self-organization and education.</p>
  <p>We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends.
  We work in solidarity with existing movements towards social justice, workers' rights, and economic inclusion.</p>
  <p>We’re a democratically structured, all-volunteer, and worker-led organization.</p>
