  <p>Guided by our vision for an inclusive & equitable tech industry, TWC organizes to build worker power through rank & file self-organization and education.</p>
  <p>We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends.
  We work in solidarity with existing movements towards social justice, workers' rights, and economic inclusion.</p>
  <p>We’re a democratically structured, all-volunteer, and worker-led organization. <b><a href="/subscribe">Get involved</a> and find (or help start) a <a href="/chapters">local chapter</a>!</b> You can also <a href="mailto:hello@techworkerscoalition.org">reach us by email.</a></p>
