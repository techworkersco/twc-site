  intro_to_unionized_workplaces: |
    <p>
    More and more tech-driven organizations are unionizing. This is an incomplete list of
    workplaces with an active union. Some of these workplaces haven't recognized their
    unions yet, or contracts have not been signed between the union and the workplace.
    Know of another one? <a href="https://github.com/techworkersco/twc-site/tree/master/_workplaces">Please add it</a>.
    </p>
