    description: While TWC is strongly affiliated with several unions around the world, and counts many union members and organizers in our ranks, we are not a union ourselves. If you're interested in unionizing, we can help! If you're curious what is out there, check out <a href="https://organize.fyi/">this (rough) list</a> of active and ongoing labor efforts in both tech and adjacent industries.

      We’re a democratically structured, all-volunteer, and worker-led organization. At this point, membership consists of attending meetings in person and working on the various projects that people are interested in. We organize online but IRL is the crux of what we do.

  intro_to_unionized_workplaces: |
    <p>
    More and more tech-driven organizations are unionizing. This is an incomplete list of
    workplaces with an active union. Some of these workplaces haven't recognized their
    unions yet, or contracts have not been signed between the union and the workplace.
    Know of another one? <a href="https://github.com/techworkersco/twc-site/tree/master/_workplaces">Please add it</a>.
