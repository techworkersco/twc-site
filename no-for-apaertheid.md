Call to Action for Tech Workers

“I work in tech and I am so sad/angry/scared about the current crisis in Gaza, but no one in tech seems to be talking about it.”

You are not alone—we are also sad, angry, scared, and more. As Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim tech workers, as anti-Zionist Jewish tech workers, as tech workers of color, and as allied tech workers, we are also sad, angry, scared, and more.

[… as tech workers of color with history of immigration and living in diaspora, we cannot unsee the parallels to our own families’ histories with imperialism and we grieve in solidarity.]

As engineers who build innovative technology for social good, we are horrified by our employers that are generating profit from this genocide. As content moderators, we are distressed by the atrocities we see from on the ground and condemn how our employers are censoring Palestinian voices. As recruiters who look for brilliant talents around the world, we mourn the lives lost due to this genocide. 


“Why has tech been silent on this?”

Many tech companies have yet to acknowledge the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. If they did make a statement, it was likely one-sided and erased the apartheid context. 

The tech industry’s silence is louder than words. As recently as last week, Mai Ubeid, a tech worker at Google, and her entire family were martyred in an Israeli airstrike. This week, the New York Times reported how tech workers are facing retaliation and discrimination for speaking up about Palestine. 

These are not individual instances. Tech is a responsible actor in the current crisis. 


“What can Tech do?” 

First and foremost, the tech industry can make a commitment to cease any defense contracts with the Israeli state. The No Tech 4 Apartheid (NOTA) campaign…  

Second, tech companies can make a strong commitment to protecting the welfare of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim tech workers, and others speaking in solidarity with the Palestinian cause. … 

One way to do this is by mobilizing your co-workers to urge your leadership to make a commitment. See our template below. 


“What can I do?” 

It is so easy to fall into despair and feel hopeless. But this can an activate moment for you to take action. 


1. Join thousands of tech workers around the world for the No Tech 4 Apartheid (NOTA) campaign. Sign up for  
    1. Teach In date and access link 


2. Organize a vigil to honor Mai and fellow tech workers impacted by the Gaza genocide. We encourage tech workers to organize an in-person vigil at their office to honor the lives of tech workers. More in this below. 


3. If you haven’t been doing so already, contact your elected officials to demand that they endorse an immdiate and unconditional ceasefire. If you vote in the U.S., call your members of Congress to demand that they endorse an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.

Dear colleagues, 

I just learned that Mai Ubeid, a tech worker at Google, and her entire family were murdered during a recent Israeli airstrike. I did not know her, but as a fellow tech worker I am heartbroken by the news and can’t help but feel connected to the countless innocent civilians, like Mai, who are being killed, injured, and displaced by the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 

The current death toll in Palestine is at 10,000+ and growing, with almost half of the deaths being children. The humanitarian situation continues to worsen as the state of Israel refuses to facilitate humanitarian corridors into Gaza to provide the needed amounts of aid. And this is not new. The blockade on Gaza, ongoing since 2007, is described by the U.N. as a “denial of basic human rights,” which includes, but is not limited to, a severe shortage of water, food, and medical care. This retaliation against an entire group of people for the acts of a few is defined as “collective punishment,” which is illegal under international law and is considered a war crime. We are all witnessing this humanitarian crisis firsthand through social media, but the very companies that facilitate these communications are silent, while our coworkers and their families are dying. 

Our company values state [INSERT COMPANY VALUES] . Yet, our leadership has made no acknowledgment of martyred tech workers, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, or its impact on our employee population.  It is disheartening to see that our values are not honored when it comes to our Palestinian colleagues.

How to Organize a Vigil 

If our leadership refuses to acknowledge how tech workers are impacted by the current crisis, then we will honor our colleagues ourselves. 

A vigil is an opportunity for a group of people to come together to honor the passing of our known and loved ones. It can be as elaborate or simple as you like. 

Date: TBD vai Mohammed 
Location: By the entrance of your office 

Vigil invitation template for your co-workers, ERGs, etc. 

In Palestine, those murdered by the occupying state are honored as shaheed, or “martyrs” As Mai’s friend and writer Anam Raheem writes beautifully and powerfully in this obituary for Mai, to be a martyr is to “become a witness to the crime of injustice.” Please join us in honoring Mai and her family’s martyrdom [INSERT VIGIL INFO].
