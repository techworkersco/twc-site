## About
We are the Canadian chapter of the Tech Workers Coalition. We have had previous iterations of Tech Workers Coalition organizing that have participated in events across Canada in 2019. We have reactivated as of summer 2025. We are one chapter of many that TWC have globally.We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends. We aim to build connections of solidarity and develop a point of view that centers workers. We welcome all workers, especially current and former tech or tech-adjacent workers to organize, learn and build worker power with us so that workers can reassert their agency, especially in the tech industry.While the membership is primarily Anglophone, we strive for a grassroots bilingual membership and welcome action and ideas for how to ensure Francophones are equally represented.
