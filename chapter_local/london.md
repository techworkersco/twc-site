# London Tech Workers Coalition

The London, UK, chapter of the TWC formed in early
2019, and the first public meeting was at [Newspeak House](https://nwspk.com/)
in September 2019, moving to [MayDay Rooms](https://www.maydayrooms.org/)
thereafter.

One year later the chapter closed, in favor of opening a [United Tech & Allied Workers](https://utaw.tech/) branch within the Communication Workers' Union.

Our definition of a "tech worker" is anyone involved in the tech industry in
any capacity &mdash; including programmers, designers, product managers,
students, gig workers (Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders etc.), and cleaners and
contractors at tech companies. All tech workers and allies are welcome to
attend any public TWC London meetings.

## Connect With Us

- Currently the best way to see what we're up to is to follow us on Twitter, at
  [@TechWorkersLDN](https://twitter.com/TechWorkersLDN), or on our
  [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TechWorkersLDN).
- We are also on [the TWC Slack](/subscribe), in the `#local-uk-london`
  channel; most of our online discussions happen here.

  Sign ups to the TWC Slack are centrally filtered and occasionally someone may
  slip through the cracks and not be granted access. If you have been waiting
  without a response for more than a week or two after signing up, please email
  or DM us on Twitter and we can try to help get you in.
