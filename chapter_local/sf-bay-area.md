# SF Bay Area Tech Workers Coalition

We are the Bay Area chapter of TWC. As of summer 2025, most of our active members and in-person meetups are in San Francisco and the East Bay, but we'd love to do more in the Peninsula and South Bay!

## About

- We are a coalition of workers in and around the tech industry, labor organizers, community organizers, and friends.
- The Bay Area chapter was restarted in 2024 after a few years of low activity.
- As of summer 2025, we host regular social meetups, a monthly reading group, and general chapter meetings for collective actions and decisions. We also periodically partner with aligned organizations for political education, fundraisers, and similar.
