        <img alt="Group photo from 2024 Circuit Breakers Conference with banner: Tech Won't Save Us\: Organize!" src="/assets/img/cb_2024.jpeg">
        <p>We consider all workers in the tech sector—from software engineers, to salespeople, to ride-share drivers—as tech workers. This conference is organized by volunteers from across the tech labor movement.</p>

        <h3>Values</h3>
      
        <p>The rank and file workers who organized this gathering aim to create a space where all workers across the tech industry—from office workers, to warehouse workers; from full time workers to contractors—can stand united in these values.</p>
        <p><b>Worker-Led</b>:<br>Workers know how to win. When we put our heads together, no one has a better understanding of how our companies function, including our bosses. We’re the ones who drive these machines, we’re the ones who write the code, and we’re the ones who know every inch of the shop floor. If we want to build leverage that brings management to the bargaining table, our strategy must draw from the wisdom of the rank and file, from us, the workers. This movement must be worker-led to meet the challenges ahead.</p>
        <p><b>Courageous</b>:<br>If we want to use our labor power to raise up our communities, workers must be brave. We must reach out to one another to have important and difficult conversations that will move us to action. We must practice working together to challenge the status quo and build resilience that can foster bravery. Workers must realise we have the collective power to change the conditions that shape our lives and win demands that will free us. No one is coming to save us but ourselves.</p>
        <p><b>Radical Care</b>:<br>Radical care is necessary for building solidarity that can overcome the arbitrary divisions that undermine our collective power. To forge a strong global movement that reaches across roles, sectors, and borders, we must create transformative spaces of belonging and distributed power. This is how we build a community that is inclusive, compassionate, and places our humanity above the pressures of capital.</p>

        <h5>When can I buy tickets?</h5>

        <h5>Can I attend this conference remotely?</h5>
        <p>This conference will be in-person only, both for logistical reasons and to respect the privacy of our attendees and their organizing. We do anticipate holding future virtual events and panels drawing on the topics and speakers of the most attended and best-received workshops.</p>
        <h5>Who is this conference for?</h5>
        <p>This is a conference for rank-and-file workers in tech who have direct experience organizing, who want to get more involved in organizing, or even have no experience as an organizer. This gathering is not for general observers like journalists or researchers. If you fall into one of these categories, you might be eligible if you have significant ties to tech organizing or the labor movement and consider yourself, broadly speaking, a participant or supporter. If you are unsure, we encourage you to reach out to confirm if this conference is for you.</p>
        <h5>Who is a tech worker?</h5>
        <p>A tech worker is any worker who works in the tech industry or for a tech company. This includes roles from software engineers to product managers, IT, sales, ride-share drivers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers, to any person who works for a tech company. Workers from all of these roles and more are encouraged to attend Circuit Breakers.</p>
        <h5>Covid Policy</h5>
        <p>We care about the safety and health of our fellow workers. All attendees will be required to rapid test for Covid within 24 hours of the conference. At registration we will ask to see documentation of your negative test results and all attendees will be expected to mask unless eating or speaking on stage.</p>
        <h5>How do I get in touch?</h5>
