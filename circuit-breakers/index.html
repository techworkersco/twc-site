        <p>We consider all workers in the tech sector—from software engineers, to salespeople, to ride-share drivers—as tech workers. This conference is organized by volunteers from across the tech labor movement.</p>

        <h3>Values</h3>
      
        <p>The rank and file workers who organized this gathering aim to create a space where all workers across the tech industry—from office workers, to warehouse workers; from full time workers to contractors—can stand united in these values.</p>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Worker-Led</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          Workers know how to win. When we put our heads together, no one has a better understanding of how our companies function, including our bosses. We’re the ones who drive these machines, we’re the ones who write the code, and we’re the ones who know every inch of the shop floor. If we want to build leverage that brings management to the bargaining table, our strategy must draw from the wisdom of the rank and file, from us, the workers. This movement must be worker-led to meet the challenges ahead.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Courageous</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          If we want to use our labor power to raise up our communities, workers must be brave. We must reach out to one another to have important and difficult conversations that will move us to action. We must practice working together to challenge the status quo and build resilience that can foster bravery. Workers must realise we have the collective power to change the conditions that shape our lives and win demands that will free us. No one is coming to save us but ourselves.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Radical Care</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          Radical care is necessary for building solidarity that can overcome the arbitrary divisions that undermine our collective power. To forge a strong global movement that reaches across roles, sectors, and borders, we must create transformative spaces of belonging and distributed power. This is how we build a community that is inclusive, compassionate, and places our humanity above the pressures of capital.
