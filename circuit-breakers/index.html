        <p>We consider all workers in the tech sector—from software engineers, to salespeople, to ride-share drivers—as tech workers. This conference is organized by volunteers from across the tech labor movement.</p>

        <h3>Values</h3>
      
        <p>The rank and file workers who organized this gathering aim to create a space where all workers across the tech industry—from office workers, to warehouse workers; from full time workers to contractors—can stand united in these values.</p>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Worker-Led</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          Workers know how to win. When we put our heads together, no one has a better understanding of how our companies function, including our bosses. We’re the ones who drive these machines, we’re the ones who write the code, and we’re the ones who know every inch of the shop floor. If we want to build leverage that brings management to the bargaining table, our strategy must draw from the wisdom of the rank and file, from us, the workers. This movement must be worker-led to meet the challenges ahead.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Courageous</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          If we want to use our labor power to raise up our communities, workers must be brave. We must reach out to one another to have important and difficult conversations that will move us to action. We must practice working together to challenge the status quo and build resilience that can foster bravery. Workers must realise we have the collective power to change the conditions that shape our lives and win demands that will free us. No one is coming to save us but ourselves.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Radical Care</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          Radical care is necessary for building solidarity that can overcome the arbitrary divisions that undermine our collective power. To forge a strong global movement that reaches across roles, sectors, and borders, we must create transformative spaces of belonging and distributed power. This is how we build a community that is inclusive, compassionate, and places our humanity above the pressures of capital.

        <h3>Call for Proposals</h3> 
        <p><b>Circuit Breakers centers rank and file organizing.</b></p>
        <p>We’re encouraging workers from across the tech labor movement to share stories, train skills, and lead important debates. Although we welcome proposals on all subjects related to labor organizing in the tech industry, our organizing committee of rank and file tech workers is particularly interested in these distinct areas:</p>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Labor Organizing Against Imperialism</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          <p>As capital exhausts existing markets and sources of labor, it enlists the state’s monopoly on violence to capture resources and labor for exploitation. For generations, workers have stood against capital’s tendencies toward genocide, oppression, and expansionist empire. In 2025, we see organized labor taking bold stances against Israeli genocide, the militarization of the US border, and the creeping global surveillance state.<b>We want to hear how you have organized and rallied against imperialism!</b></p>
          <p>Has anti-imperialism been a part of your organizing efforts? Some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How our union rallied to support immigrant workers</li>
            <li>We rallied our union around anti-genocide and anti-apartheid demands (UAW)</li>
            <li>When the bosses told us to build software to support drone strike, we refused</li>
            <li>The bosses told us to return to the office, but we knew ICE was waiting, so we fought back</li>
            <li>Our coworker was imprisoned and tortured at the border, and when the bosses did nothing, we rallied to get them released</li>
            <li>Putting out a union statement opposing the tariffs and defending internationalism</li>
            <li>Opposing contracts with ICE, NSA and the military</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><b>Workers Taking on Technology:</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          <p>Technology in the service of capitalism has historically always been wielded against workers’ interests. Labor is the sole source of value and therefore profits, so automation and mechanization actually threaten profitability. Capital responds with layoffs, speedup, and intensification of labor to increase exploitation and buoy the rate of profit. To what extent this takes place depends on the labor movement. The first impulse may be to rage against the machines, but for the long term, labor needs an alternative vision in which progress doesn’t antagonize us. This can start with worker control over the deployment of new technologies--over the products we tech workers produce.</p>  
          <p><b>Have you taken on these issues in your organizing work? e.g</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mobilizing against layoffs or including contract language preventing or mitigating layoffs</li>
            <li>Including contract language that prevents AI from replacing jobs (SAG-AFTRA)</li>
            <li>Preventing workplace or work device surveillance (Kickstarter)</li>
            <li>Establishing worker control over how AI and automation is deployed (labor, safety, environmental impacts)</li>
            <li>Union control over hiring, apprenticeship programs and retooling (ILA, ILWU)</li>
            <li>Developing connections between tech workers and warehouse/logistics workers</li>
            <li>Opposing speedup & automated/algorithmic supervision</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><b>Bold Strategy:</b> (click to expand)</summary>
          <p>Organizing in the tech industry has changed dramatically over the past few years. To meet the challenges ahead will require bold strategy that can withstand the austerity and labor discipline we’ve experienced in the wake of mass layoffs and the technocrat capture of democracy. <b>If you have learnings to share or a discussion to lead about strategy that will inspire or inform other workers across the tech industry, we highly encourage you to apply to this area of interest.</b> Here are a few examples of the kinds of talks we’re hoping to see for this focus area:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to build solidarity and high participation in the face of longer hours and increased atomization.</li>
            <li>How our union fought to restore DEI measures after leadership bent to the Trump administration.</li>
            <li>Analyzing membership structures like solidarity unionism or the direct join model.</li>
            <li>How to push back against a passive national that is undermining your strike threat.</li>
            <li>Organizing an action against a Return To Office mandate.</li>
            <li>Mobilizing across divisions to expand your bargaining unit and work toward wall-to-wall solidarity.</li>
            <li>Exposing Littler Mendelson’s union-busting consulting tactics.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <p>If you have a session idea, we encourage you to take 10 minutes to fill out this simple form. We’re very excited to hear what you have to contribute to the tech labor movement and this year’s Circuit Breakers. </p>
