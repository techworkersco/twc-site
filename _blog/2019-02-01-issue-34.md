We cherish the reminder this week's App Store drama affords us: the tech bosses will go to any lengths necessary to exploit all humans'&nbsp;data and advance their domination; and there's little holding them accountable other than violating the terms of service of likewise domination-minded platforms.

<!--excerpt-->
  
Here's the high level of what happened: Apple offers "Enterprise Certificates" to employers to distribute apps without undergoing any review process. When news broke this week that [Facebook and Google](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/googles-also-peddling-a-data-collector-through-apples-back-door/) were using the enterprise certificate work-around to get apps on consumer phones that would grant limitless access to all the data on a phone, [Apple hastened to take the apps offline](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps).  
  
Devices with the "research apps" gave Facebook and Google the&nbsp;"ability to [continuously collect the following types of data](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/): private messages in social media apps, chats from in instant messaging apps – including photos/videos sent to others, emails, web searches, web browsing activity, and even ongoing location information by tapping into the feeds of any location tracking apps you may have installed.”&nbsp;  
  
[Facebook has shut&nbsp;down the "research app"](https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/1/30/18203349/facebook-research-app-apple-shutdown),&nbsp;[as has Google](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18204064/apple-google-monitoring-phone-usage-screenwise-meter)&nbsp;and Apple has since restored their certificates. Developers in the community have [pointed out that smaller businesses or independent developers would've likely lost their developer account and banned from the app store](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1090632018159910912), while Google and Facebook resumed business as usual within hours thanks to back room executive bargains and special treatment.  
  
While this latest example of tech giants'&nbsp;unchecked aggregation&nbsp;of all the world's data is of no surprise to anybody, the ensuing havoc and the interconnectedness of app&nbsp;distribution that resulted a kind of single point of failure has been both entertaining and enlightening.  
  
When Apple revoked Facebook's developer certificates, it took all of their internal apps offline along with the research app — disrupting any work happening those days on in development or beta versions of apps (i.e. most software work at Facebook as well as logistics apps that disrupted shuttle bus schedules).  

The entire tech industry is based on nefarious data extraction, but we only see consequences for companies when they offend the TOS of another company. When we organize, we take matters into our own hands;&nbsp;we can make a world we want to live in.
