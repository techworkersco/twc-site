   58  [Uber's quarterly losses](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-eats-grew-like-hell-in-q1-but-ubers-still-lost-nearly-3b/) are now so astronomical that the company is [laying off](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/more-uber-layoffs/) 3,000 employees and closing 45 offices.

That's a deeply political failing that they're caught in the middle of." We as workers and users can't rely on unaccountable executives to make good on vague promises.
