Our goal in this newsletter is mutual aid, tech workers for tech workers. The most valuable, enjoyable part of our process is talking with fellow workers – the stories we publish are a bonus.

Now, we invite you to talk with fellow workers too. To have a safe and trusting space with people in different workplaces but similar situations. To leverage experience among allies in labor and tech. To get perspective and get organized.

**[Sign up to give or get peer support](https://airtable.com/shrU1rYELjqaM5pqp)**.

We’ll reach out to everyone who fills in the form. And there's more coming this fall, including an intergenerational teach-in that builds on [our series](https://news.techworkerscoalition.org/2021/06/19/issue-13/) about the IBM Black Workers Alliance.
