Fifty years ago this May, over 10 million French workers joined protesting students in the largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced industrial country, and the first wildcat general strike in history. Striking workers occupied 122 factories all across France, crippling the economy and nearly toppling the government. The rebellion wasn't participated in by a lone demographic, such as workers or students, but was a popular uprising that superseded ethnic, cultural, age and class boundaries.

### Worker's Perspective

Fifty years ago this May, over 10 million French workers joined protesting students in the largest general strike that ever stopped the economy of an advanced industrial country, and the first wildcat general strike in history. Striking workers occupied 122 factories all across France, crippling the economy and nearly toppling the government. The rebellion wasn't participated in by a lone demographic, such as workers or students, but was a popular uprising that superseded ethnic, cultural, age and class boundaries.  
  
_“The occupations movement was obviously a rejection of alienated labor; it was a festival, a game, a real presence of people and of time. And it was a rejection of all authority, all specialization, all hierarchical dispossession; a rejection of the state and thus of the parties and unions — the workers were leading, in their occupations and actions.”_

###  News

The terror of Amazon abounds. Its facial recognition technology, "Rekognition" is already in use by the city of Orlando and the Washington County in Oregon's sheriff's office, with agencies in Arizona and California in their customer pipeline. [**Amazon is not only marketing its facial recognition service as a "law enforcement service", it is actively "helping governments deploy it."**](https://www.aclunc.org/blog/amazon-teams-law-enforcement-deploy-dangerous-new-face-recognition-technology) Amazon touts the power and accuracy of the face detection model, but has taken no measure to combat or even acknowledge the fact that [**facial recognition systems have "higher error rates for women and people of color — error rates that can translate directly into more stops and arrests for marginalized groups"**](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384632/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-racial-bias-audit-data). There&nbsp;are no "big data" companies; there are only surveillance companies. This is why we organize. And this is why we acknowledge any brave workers within Amazon who are trying to put a stop to this gross violation of our civil liberties.&nbsp;  
  
This news follows the continued advocacy within and outside Google to call on Google leadership to cancel the Department of Defense contract to custom build a solution to use AI to identify and track potential targets, known as the **Maven contract**. We [learned this week](https://gizmodo.com/the-pentagons-controversial-drone-ai-imaging-project-ex-1826046321)&nbsp;the contract is valued at $9m. We [also learned](https://www.wired.com/story/the-line-between-big-tech-and-defense-work/) Googlers are considering a work to rule action by refusing to conduct interviews in order to slow down company progress. We salute the brave Googlers contemplating this action and encourage them to keep going. No big win is won without sustained effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
From our streets into our homes, Amazon's surveillance violates at every level: [**Amazon Alexa users reported yesterday that the device recorded their conversations and sent them to a random contact in their phone**](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/woman-says-her-amazon-device-recorded-private-conversation-sent-it-out-to-random-contact/755507974).&nbsp;

He writes: "The tech industry is motivated by endless profit, elite status, rampant greed, and the myth that their technologies are somehow always improving the world.” Preach!
