Over the last week, TWC peeps got to spend time with the author of _Striking to Survive: Workers’ Resistance to Factory Relocations_ _in China_ and his partner as part of their U.S. book tour. Before coming to the Bay Area, they did talks throughout the Northeast, then again in the Midwest, before coming out West. Along the way, they did several interviews with seasoned veterans of shopfloor struggles since the 1960s. One of us shares an account of our time together:

### Worker's Perspective

Over the last week, TWC peeps got to spend time with the author of _Striking to Survive: Workers’ Resistance to Factory Relocations_ _in China_ and his partner as part of their U.S. book tour. Before coming to the Bay Area, they did talks throughout the Northeast, then again in the Midwest, before coming out West. Along the way, they did several interviews with seasoned veterans of shopfloor struggles since the 1960s. One of us shares an account of our time together:
>
> The first event in the Bay Area was a dinner party at this writer’s San Francisco apartment, which included about 15 people, including tech workers, a half dozen teachers (including me), a restaurant worker, and a union representative for one of the more militant local unions. This week there were book talks at activist spaces, bookshops, colleges and universities, in Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Cupertino, San Jose and finally last nights’ event co-sponsored by TWC at Stanford.
>
> The dinner party involved a collective discussion that started with all of us introducing ourselves, stating our own work sectors and briefly describing some of our organizing experience. Then the author and his partner discussed the struggles in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) area of Guangdong Province that the book documents. It was a lively conversation, ranging from the experiences of class struggle around the world and how this has been transforming over the last several generations. For those whose personal account had a high point, it was usually around a strike. It was a lively exchange of ideas and a great informal kick-off for the book tour.
>
> Most of the other talks were to wider audiences at colleges and universities, whose lack of organizing experience work was often simply because their struggle for survival involves the difficulties of getting by with multiple jobs while also studying. Most had yet to reach a point of open struggle, but there was a sincere desire on their part to learn from the experience of our guests. They too had once been university graduates, who opted to move from the north of China to work in factories and be part of the strikes and struggles of the working class of the PRD.
>
> At the final event last night at Stanford, more of the participants had both organizing experience and an awareness of global struggles of the working class, which drove the discussion to deeper aspects of class struggle. Fan Shigang, the author, expressed his desire to learn from the experiences of American workers. To many of us, myself included, this seemed counter-intuitive based on the declining fortunes of “labor” in the U.S.; one question reflected this apparent contradiction. Fan’s answer bookended his whole week of talks in the Bay Area when he said that Chinese workers are good at organizing strikes at the slightest provocation, but they have not been able sustain the strikes beyond a single factory (with a few exceptions, like the storm wave of strikes sparked by the Honda parts factory strike in 2010) nor have they been able to build networks to coordinate struggles and to pass on the traditions and wisdom gained in these strikes.
>
> Reflecting on this, I was able to ask the last question of the night about what lessons the author, his partner and their informal group had learned from their study of class struggle not only in the U.S., but throughout the world. He mentioned how they had translated the biography of South Korean labor martyr Jeon Tae-il and about how they had interviewed half a dozen militant railroaders in North America, members of Railroad Workers United (RWU) who are trying to bridge the 13 craft unions in their industry, and then his last example shocked even me. He said he had arrived in San Francisco and had met all the people at the dinner at my apartment and was impressed that he had sat in a room with over a dozen workers, from various sectors, with some in their seventies and others in their twenties (pointing to some TWC members who had been there). He said there was an inter-generational sharing of organizing ideas and experiences, mixed with stories of both successes and failures, and he emphasized that this doesn’t happen in China. In the PRD they are the “new working class,” starting from scratch, and they do not have militant elders to consult with and learn from. I was shocked into realizing that my older – and younger – working class comrades are a valuable resource that I will never again take for granted – our Chinese visitors certainly don’t.

###  In The News

[**Google is out of the running for the $10 billion JEDI Pentagon cloud project**](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-10-08/google-drops-out-of-pentagon-s-10-billion-cloud-competition), a huge victory for the thousands of employees who stood up to say [Google should not be in the business of war](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43656378). TWC offers the following statement in support of these brave workers:

> Google had every intention of bidding for, and possibly winning, the JEDI contract. They spent considerable resources and hours of top executive time courting military officials to do exactly this. They only dropped out due to sustained employee pressure. In their statement, Google points to its AI principles as the reason for this decision (principles that are themselves a response to internal dissent). The truth is that the project was stopped by the thousands of workers who demanded a say in what they build, and refused to contribute their talents to efforts they believed to be unethical, like Maven and JEDI. Tech workers have significant power, and are increasingly willing to use it.

[**Amazon exercises total control over delivery drivers**](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-controls-delivery-drivers-without-paying-wages-2018-9), monitoring and directing their every move through the use of package scanning and route navigation devices.

### Song Of The Week

#### [**Gil Scott-Heron & Brian Jackson - Three Miles Down**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhqqF7oNxGg)
  
_Here come the mine cars_  
_And it's damn near dawn_  
_Another shift of men, some of them my friends, comin' on_  
_Hard to imagine workin' in the mines_  
_Coal dust in your lungs, on your skin and on your mind_  
_I've listened to the speeches_  
_But it occurred&nbsp;to me politicians don't understand_  
_The thoughts of isolation, ain't no sunshine underground_  
_It's like workin' in a graveyard three miles down_  

_Damn near a legend as old as the mines_  
_Things that happen in the pits just don't change with the times_  
_Work 'till you're exhausted in too little space_  
_A history of disastrous fears etched on your face_  
_Somebody signs a paper, every body thinks it's fine_  
_But Taft and Hartley ain't done one day in the mines_  
_You start to stiffen! You heard a crackin' sound!_  
_It's like workin' in a graveyard three miles down_
