### Worker's Perspective

A week after Google dropped out of the running for the Pentagon's project [JEDI, Jeff Bezos double-downed on Amazon's pursuit of the contract](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-defends-big-tech-working-government-one-week-google-drops-pentagon-contract/) to be the cloud provider for the Department of Defense.

Workers at Amazon responded with a statement making known their open dissent.
  
> We follow in the steps of the Googlers who spoke out against the Maven contract and Microsoft employees who are speaking out against the JEDI contract. Regardless of our views on the military, no one should be profiting from “increasing the lethality” of the military. We will not silently build technology to oppress and kill people, whether in our country or in others.
>
> We should remember that while Sanders may have brought the wage issue to the forefront in recent months, this $15-per-hour concession is the result of many former and current workers speaking out and increasing signs of workers’ organizing in warehouses, from Minnesota to Madrid. This win was worker-driven, and I think if we want to be able to change anything at corporate, those efforts will also have to be worker-driven.
>
> We just have to keep working, keep building a network of people who care about this, and keep fighting. Maybe we won’t win the demands of the letter in the short term, but if we keep working together, we can build lasting power.
  
Read the [open letter from Amazon employees](https://medium.com/s/story/im-an-amazon-employee-my-company-shouldn-t-sell-facial-recognition-tech-to-police-36b5fde934ac)&nbsp;as well as an&nbsp;[interview here](https://medium.com/s/oversight/shock-anger-disappointment-an-amazon-employee-speaks-out-88d927792950)[&nbsp;with one of the letter writers here](https://medium.com/s/oversight/shock-anger-disappointment-an-amazon-employee-speaks-out-88d927792950).  
  
And last Friday, [Microsoft employees wrote a similar letter](https://medium.com/s/story/an-open-letter-to-microsoft-dont-bid-on-the-us-military-s-project-jedi-7279338b7132):  
  
> When we decided to work at Microsoft, we were doing so in the hopes of “empowering every person on the planet to achieve more,” not with the intent of ending lives and enhancing lethality.

Our industry behaves like our tech bosses are brilliant heroes, gods that have risen to their achievement through hard work and sheer genius. If that wasn't egregious enough, lately we've seen that they fancy themselves heads of state. The same reasons our tech bosses have excelled at capitalism, their mastery over a profit-over-people market, their pursuit of trillion-dollar valuations rather than livability for all workers, are the exact same reasons these men should never be state leaders. We don't tolerate any action that suggests otherwise, and we won't standby.

### Song Of The Week

#### [**We Will Win by Fifteen**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0LbH0CI9QuHHDFvwNDARmZ?si=5x3kZCItT-adKOtgeR-Wyg)

_But your boss don't pay you shit_  
_You're one check away from_  
_Being homeless just like me._  
_Lower class, middle class, no class we're all the same_  
_We got all the bosses, we got landlords, we all play the slavery game_  
_They've got the guns but we got the numbers._  
_When the people are one we will be unstoppable_  
_Everybody knows employment is just abuse anyway_  
_Everybody knows its just no use anyway_  
_So Kill your boss today_  
_We will win_
