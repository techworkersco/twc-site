**Scholars tell UC Berkeley to cut ties with Palantir**

Berkeley Law hosted a top privacy and law conference this week. Since 2011 the conference has received sponsorship from Palantir and this year hundreds of academics decided they have had enough in light of the recent revelation that Palantir's technology was used to separate families. [Over 300 of them signed a letter](https://mijente.net/2019/05/29/scholars-tell-uc-berkeley-cut-ties-with-palantir/)&nbsp;put out by the Latinx advocacy group Mijente, calling on the event organizers to drop Palantir sponsorship.  

<!--excerpt-->

[The organizers refused](https://twitter.com/hoofnagle/status/1133789284291424256). They argued that corporate sponsors like Palantir don't have any influence on content or speakers. However, allowing Palantir to sponsor this event helps the company to polish its image, and thus undermines efforts to resist militarized surveillance against migrants and marginalized communities. It's worth pointing out that the two primary organizers of the conference are also Palantir advisors.  
  
This academic letter follows a series of actions from [TWC volunteers](https://www.fastcompany.com/90348304/exclusive-tech-workers-organize-protest-against-palantir-on-the-github-coding-platform), [Stanford students](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/student-groups-protest-salesforce-palantir-ice-campus) and **[organizers](https://www.newsweek.com/video-activists-build-giant-ice-cage-burning-man-slam-palantir-and-amazon-1101788)**[**seeking to stop Palantir from building tech**](https://www.newsweek.com/video-activists-build-giant-ice-cage-burning-man-slam-palantir-and-amazon-1101788) that makes up the backbone of the racist enforcement of immigration policy.  
  
We stand with everyone who has suffered from ICE's brutal treatment of immigrants. We commit not to build or support technology that brutalize immigrant and marginalized.

_A friend of mine dropped me a line_  
_It said, "man, I gotta run to the USA_   _I got no money, got no job"_   _She skipped out of Mexico to stay alive_  

_You've got a problem with her living here_  
_But what did you do to help her before she fucking came?_  
_What did the country do?_  
_What did the people do?_  

_I stand not by my country, but by people of the whole fucking world_  
_No fences, no borders_  
_Free movement for all_
