Two Tech Workers Coalition volunteers recently sat down with the hosts of the Delete Your Account Podcast to talk worker-to-worker solidarity in the tech industry. **[Hear the full conversation here](https://deleteyouraccount.libsyn.com/episode-116-tech-solidarity)**.&nbsp;  

<!--excerpt-->

> "As workers in Silicon Valley we can feel atomized and so isolated from each other; often we lack authentic community. Our foundational work, then, is building relationships between each other —&nbsp;authentic friendships built in trust is foundational to our organizing.
>
> The next layer of that foundation is gaining&nbsp;knowledge of the lineage of workers who built power before us. A couple months ago we met with a visiting Chinese factory worker; as he told us about frequent wildcat strikes organized by his peers we asked him why he would come to America&nbsp;for a conversation about labor when our country has gutted the power of workers&nbsp;and handed power to institutions. He told us that we have a tradition of labor struggle in the United States, that there are elders here we can learn from. And he's right — we are conducting our own education about the elders who came before us, the members of the labor community, we're self-educating about our rights on the job and reminding each other that we don't have to go to our managers or HR to make change. We are building relationships in our actual community, to our coworkers and to those already engaged in the struggle.
>
> And so, Tech Workers Coalition is a network that is both social and educational. We're doing leadership development, that is, self-leadership development, so that we're creating a reproducible network of leaders that will bring this work everywhere."

###  In The News

[**Google temps, vendors and contractors have raised their collective voice to demand an end to pay and opportunity inequity and access to company-wide information on the same terms as full time employees**](https://slate.com/business/2018/12/google-walkout-protests-contract-workers.html). In a letter published on Medium, TVCs&nbsp;called out management practices that cruelly quantify the value of a contractor's life against the life of a full-time employee:  

> Google’s mission is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible.” But the company fails to meet this standard within its own workplace. Google routinely denies TVCs access to information that is relevant to our jobs and our lives. When the tragic shooting occurred at YouTube in April of this year, the company sent real-time security updates to full-time employees only, leaving TVCs defenseless in the line of fire. TVCs were then excluded from a town hall discussion the following day. And when 20,000 full-time and TVC Google employees walked out to demand equal treatment for all workers, TVCs were again excluded from the company-wide discussion held a week later. The exclusion of TVCs from important communications and fair treatment is part of a system of institutional racism, sexism, and discrimination. TVCs are disproportionately people from marginalized groups who are treated as less deserving of compensation, opportunities, workplace protections, and respect. We wear different badges from full-time employees, which reinforces this arbitrary and discriminatory separation. Even when we’re doing the same work as full-time employees, these jobs routinely fail to provide living wages and often offer minimal benefits. This affects not only us, but also our families and communities.

_Skip out for beer during commercials_  
_Because the revolution will not be televised_

_The revolution will not be brought to you by Xerox_  
_In 4 parts without commercial interruption_  
_The revolution will not show you pictures of Nixon_  
_Blowing a bugle and leading a charge by John Mitchell General Abrams and Spiro Agnew to eat_  
_Hog maws confiscated from a Harlem sanctuary_  
 
_The revolution will not be televised_
