Money, it turns out, can't buy you friends. Besieged by employee calls to #CancelTheContract with CBP, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offered to donate $250,000 to Texas nonprofit RAICES, to draw attention away from the contract. RAICES [refused the donation](https://twitter.com/RAICESTEXAS/status/1019975176140701696), sending shockwaves through the industry:&nbsp;_"We will not be a beneficiary of your effort to buy your way out of ethical responsibility."_

News from the border, meanwhile, has only gotten worse, as [children have given firsthand accounts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/us/migrant-children-shelters.html) to media of [their abuse in so-called detention facilities](https://www.texasobserver.org/treated-worse-than-dogs-immigrant-kids-in-detention-give-firsthand-accounts-of-squalid-conditions/). Their stories include [violent abuse and threats of sexual violence, among other heinous atrocities](https://www.newsweek.com/customs-and-border-control-beat-kicked-and-threatened-migrant-children-under-941385?amp=1&__twitter_impression=true). We will not stand by as our employers continue to support these organizations.&nbsp;  
  
As tough as things are right now, our spirits are lifted by the words of the late, great labor organizer William Sylvis (1828-1869): "Single handed we can accomplish nothing, but united there is no power of wrong that we cannot openly defy."

On Wednesday, the clock turned back 100 years, as [police in Spain attacked peacefully demonstrating Amazon warehouse workers](https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Spain-Amazon-Workers-on-Strike-Attacked-by-National-Police-20180717-0012.html), [over 96% of whom had joined together in a strike against the Seattle tech giant](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-warehouse-strike-in-spain-reportedly-results-in-1827676740). The workers were demonstrating for better wages and improvements to what are grueling, abusive working conditions. The strength of this strike dramatically slowed Amazon's ability to meet Prime Day demand, while the overwhelming display of violence by Spanish police demonstrated that we really are in a new Gilded Age.

While Amazon workers endured brutal violence in Spain while fighting for their rights, locally, over 100 members of the San Jose community came out to [block the doors of the Amazon store](https://www.facebook.com/SVRising/videos/2111378375793186/%5D)&nbsp;and tell Amazon that we are not standing by while they help ICE and make facial recognition software for police. Workers around the world are waking up to the fact that all of these issues are connected.

If it's all still got you down, try reading [**The Only Amazon Prime Day Guide You Need**](https://splinternews.com/the-only-amazon-prime-day-guide-you-need-1827624247). Here's a preview:
