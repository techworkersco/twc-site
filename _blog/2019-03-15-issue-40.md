News broke on Monday&nbsp;of a second case of Google's&nbsp;multi-million dollar payout for a perpetrator of sexual harassment. The next day workers across the industry took to Twitter under the hashtag #GooglePayoutsForAll to shed light on a system that allocates wealth to abusers at the expense of the workers on the bottom.

<!--excerpt-->

The payouts—that we know of—given to the two execs asked to quietly leave after instances of sexual abuse against their employees [now total&nbsp;$135 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/technology/google-misconduct-exit-package.html). Google walkout organizers asked and Tweeters answered:&nbsp;How else could we use that money&nbsp;if the bosses couldn't use it to empower their abuses?

While we're on the subject of "135"s that should be redistributed, the $135 billion that is Jeff Bezos's net worth is also on our minds this week as we read accounts from the workers who are nickled-and-dimed [while surviving—and sometimes not surviving—the hell on earth that is an Amazon warehouse](https://www.thedailybeast.com/amazon-the-shocking-911-calls-from-inside-its-warehouses?ref=scroll).

Reporters who culled through 911 logs across the country determined that from 2013 to 2018, emergency response teams were summoned "at least 189 times for&nbsp;suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, and other mental-health episodes." That number represents&nbsp;46 warehouses in 17 states, or the only 25% of US Amazon warehouses for which data was made available.

The reports include devastating images of workers attempting suicide with box cutters at their work stations; depression made worse from clocking in before sunrise and clocking out after sunset for days on end; chronic, day-long, aching pain; chapped, raw, open skin; "burst blood vessels in the backs of my knees, my fingertips grayed and eerily smooth, as if my fingerprints had worn away".

Workers get two 15-minute and one 30-minute break on their 10.5 hour day shifts, those increments are&nbsp;also roughly about as long as it takes to walk across the warehouse and get frisked on their way in and out of security. The breaks are also the best time to use the bathroom since the packers' and pickers' targets are unceasingly monitored;&nbsp;their work is simultaneously grueling, boring, mentally-taxing and&nbsp;pressure-driven with quotas like&nbsp;120 packed boxes in a single hour, over and over again.

Amazon has acquired a patent for employee-tracking wristbands that "monitor workers’ movements and vibrate to nudge them when it thinks they’re slacking off." Relentless is the best word to describe it, one worker says, and as&nbsp;he points out, "**[Relentless" was Bezos's preferred name for Amazon before starting the company](https://onezero.medium.com/relentless-com-life-as-a-cog-in-amazons-e-tail-machine-d46b3ef05eb8);**&nbsp;even today Relentless.com redirects to Amazon.com.

It is a work environment designed to&nbsp;burn out and expire workers so they can soon be replaced with more disposable workers in a continuous cycle of being disposed of. And it's how Bezos accrues $135 billion in personal wealth at a company now worth $1 trillion.

### Organizing Tip Of The Week

**DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND&nbsp;**

This is a pretty common trap for organizers to fall into: someone on the organizing committee is incredibly passionate, they're doing one on ones like it's their job. They want more responsibility, they're stepping up; sure they have some personal conflicts with folks, but that will work itself out soon enough, right?

Not necessarily.

Organizing isn't just measured in one on ones or in assignments completed. It's also measured in collaboration and teamwork. We're all complicated people with our own issues to work through, but when someone's issues end up affecting other organizers, you have a problem on your hands that needs to be addressed immediately. On the one hand, you have someone who may need direction to learn how to work with others; on the other hand, you have the other organizers and maybe even potential organizers who are carefully assessing whether you're worth the time, energy, and risk. Every situation is different, but no interpersonal conflict can lie forever—and when you do address it, bear in mind the inequities in broader society that may exacerbate the issues. We're organizing for the liberation of the entire working class, after all.

### Song Of The Week

#### [D.R. Hooker - Forge Your Own Chains - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFdCDB0W3dQ)

_Can't dig what you're doin'_  
_I won't know you pretty soon_  
_Got to try to improve your brain_  
_To see. It's clear you forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_

_Maybe one more cigarette to clear your head_  
_Today you're living; tomorrow you're dead_  
_Consequences aren't always the same_  
_A link… I think… You forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_

_You're thinking the hard stuff ain't so bad_  
_Stick with it and believe me you'll wind up sad_  
_Stop it now. Don't do it again_  
_You see, it's clear you forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_

_Drown you sorrows in a drink_  
_Don't hurt anyone. That's what you think_  
_Your reason and your mind are getting mighty lame_  
_I know you know you forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own chains_  
_Forge your own…_
