# No Tech for Apartheid: Call to Action

On Wednesday, the [New York Times
reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/israel-palestine-google-employees.html)
that tech workers are facing retaliation and discrimination for speaking up
about Palestine. Google workers have published an [open
letter](https://medium.com/@notechforapartheid/googleopenletter-868f0c4477db)
describing some of the retaliation they’ve been experiencing. And just last
week, we learned of a tech worker Mai Ubeid’s
[death](https://anamraheem.substack.com/p/a-delicate-small-gazelle) in Gaza
following a recent Israeli airstrike. In this moment of grief, rage, and fear,
we call on our community to take action to hold our leadership accountable.
**If you’re here to take action, jump to [“What can I do?”](#what-can-i-do).**

## “What can I do?”

It is so easy to fall into despair and feel hopeless. But if we take action
together, collectively workers have the power to change this situation. Here
are five immediate action items you can take: 

* **Organize**: Join the [No Tech For
  Apartheid](https://www.notechforapartheid.com) campaign. Join our upcoming
  mass calls to meet each other and learn about upcoming actions: 
  * Thursday, 12/7, 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT:
    [Register](https://jvp-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIqdeCoqjkvG9GF1caO-oZiQrgHeEYw2Y2b#/registration)

* **Outreach**: Message your coworkers in your team, org, and ERGs to get them
  involved too, so we can build a movement that’s ready for this moment. Check
  out some [template communications](#template-email-to-your-coworkers-org-ergs)
  we have below.

* **Mobilize**: When our leadership refuses to acknowledge how tech workers are
  impacted by the current crisis, we will honor our colleagues ourselves.
  Organizing a vigil is an opportunity for us to come together to honor the
  passing of tech workers like Mai. Pick a date and an entrance to your office
  where you will gather. To organize a vigil at your office, see
  [bit.ly/VigilHowTo](https://bit.ly/VigilHowTo). 

* **Learn**: Educate yourself about the current crisis. Bring your coworkers to
  the many virtual teach-ins that Palestinian groups have been organizing.
  * No to APEC, No to Aparthied teach-in (virtual): Tuesday, 11/14, 4 p.m. ET /
    1 p.m.  ET: [Register here](https://bit.ly/NOTA-TeachIn)

* **Call Congress**: Of course, if you haven’t been doing so already, contact
  your elected officials to demand that they endorse an immediate and
  unconditional ceasefire. If you vote in the U.S., call your members of Congress
  to demand that they endorse an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Both
  [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/action-alerts/)
  and [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/) make it really easy, but you can also
  [contact your representative
  directly](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative).

## “I work in tech and I am so sad, angry, and scared about the current crisis in Gaza, but no one in tech seems to be talking about it.”

You are not alone—we are also sad, angry, scared, and more. As Palestinian,
Arab, and Muslim tech workers; as anti-Zionist Jewish tech workers; as tech
workers of color with histories of displacement, migration, and diaspora; as
engineers and designers who want to build technology for social good; as trust
and safety workers who want to keep our technologies safe; and as allied tech
workers standing in solidarity, we share your grief, anger, fear, and more. 

Workers are beginning to speak up about the atrocities in front of us, and
they’re asking tough questions that our leaders are trying to silence and
ignore. These workers are facing [retaliation and
harassment](https://medium.com/@notechforapartheid/googleopenletter-868f0c4477db)
for speaking truth to power. But we are stronger together. Every day we find
new voices and connect them with each other, and together we’re forming a
chorus that’s crying out for peace. Join us so we can build an industry where
people can stand together for human rights.

## “Why has leadership in the tech industry been silent on this?”

The tech industry’s silence speaks louder than words. Many tech companies have
yet to acknowledge the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Those that did have
made [one-sided
statements](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/bj8f1tfbt) that
erase the context of apartheid.

The tech industry has a long history of violating Palestinian rights through
censorship. Workers are [targeted for speaking amidst their employers’
silence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/22/google-amazon-meta-gaza-israel-contracts/),
and their employers are standing idly by or providing one-sided enforcement of
harassment and discrimination policies. They want to quell any dissent so that
we continue to churn out profits for them without complaint, even when tech
workers and their families are victims of the militarism they’re enabling. Just
last week, we learned of [Mai Ubeid’s
death](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-11-07/gaza-palestine-israel-bombing-tech-sector-coders-silicon-valley)
following a recent Israeli airstrike. Mai was one of many Palestinian tech
workers at [Gaza Sky Geeks](https://gazaskygeeks.com/), a Google-backed
co-working space, startup hub, and coding school, who dreamt of [creating
technology](https://youtu.be/GSb_lgNawK0) to support the lives of those living
with disability.

Our leadership may lack the courage to stand against apartheid, and they may
choose to be silent or turn away from this devastation - but we don’t have to
make the same choices. We can demand that the industry do more.

## “What can Tech do?”

This is a moment of crisis. **First and foremost, tech workers must organize to
demand their employers cease any defense contracts.** Through the [No Tech For
Apartheid](https://www.notechforapartheid.com) (NOTA) campaign, workers at
Google and Amazon are [taking bold
action](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-08-29/google-cloud-employees-protest-israeli-military-contract)
demanding the cancelation of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion dollar contract
with the Israeli military and government to build cloud infrastructure for
military use. Workers across the tech industry are starting to follow,
organizing to demand their companies cease any defense contracts with the
Israeli state.

**Second, companies must stop propagating Israeli misinformation and censoring
Palestinian solidarity content.** Our employers have extensive experience
protecting freedom of expression, especially that of marginalized and oppressed
communities, and ensuring that users have access to verified information. 

**Third, tech companies must protect the welfare of Palestinian, Arab, and
Muslim tech workers, and others speaking out in solidarity against apartheid.**
Tech companies must start by addressing harassment and discrimination targeted
at them in and out of the workplace.

It’s time for tech companies to recognize that the labor they employ have
voices, perspectives, and needs that they can no longer ignore. Technology
should be used to build a better world, not wreck it, and it’s time for us to
call on our employers to build it.

Dear colleagues, 

I just learned that [Mai
Ubeid](https://anamraheem.substack.com/p/a-delicate-small-gazelle), a former
tech worker at Google, and her entire family were murdered during a recent
Israeli airstrike. I did not know her, but as a fellow tech worker I am
heartbroken by the news and can’t help but feel connected to the countless
innocent civilians, like Mai, who are being killed, injured, and displaced by
the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 

The current death toll in Palestine is at 10,500+ and growing, with almost half
of the deaths being children. [Healthcare facilities are on the brink of
collapse](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-28)—71%
of hospitals have shut down due to Israeli airstrikes and bombardment. The
humanitarian situation continues to worsen as the state of Israel refuses to
facilitate humanitarian corridors into Gaza to provide the needed amounts of
aid. And this is not new. The blockade on Gaza, ongoing since 2007, is
described by the U.N. as a [“denial of basic human
rights,”](https://www.un.org/unispal/humanitarian-situation-in-the-gaza-strip-fast-facts-ocha-factsheet/)
which includes, but is not limited to, a severe shortage of water, food, and
medical care. This retaliation against an entire group of people for the acts
of a few is defined as “[collective
punishment](https://casebook.icrc.org/a_to_z/glossary/collective-punishments),”
which is illegal under international law and is considered a war crime. We are
witnessing this humanitarian crisis firsthand through social media, but the
very companies that facilitate these communications are silent, while our
coworkers and their families are dying. 

Our company values state [INSERT COMPANY VALUES] . Yet, our leadership has made
no acknowledgment of martyred tech workers, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, or
its impact on our employee population.  It is disheartening to see that our
values are not honored when it comes to our Palestinian colleagues. 

[IF GOOGLE OR AMAZON] Unfortunately, our employer’s silence on this matter
should come as no surprise: Google and Amazon hold a $1.2B contract with Israel
through with they directly profit off of this genocidal campaign. This
contract, Project Nimbus, provides the Israeli military with an [“all
encompassing cloud
solution”](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/2021-04-21/ty-article/israel-picks-google-amazon-for-official-state-cloud/0000017f-e896-dc91-a17f-fc9fd1ce0000)
and [AI-driven facial
recognition](https://theintercept.com/2022/07/24/google-israel-artificial-intelligence-project-nimbus/),
sentiment analysis, and object tracking tools which are likely deployed in the
violent policing and surveillance of Palestinians. Despite vocal worker
protest, Google and Amazon have thus far refused to cancel Project Nimbus and
instead have [retaliated against
employees](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2022-03-15/google-project-nimbus-ariel-koren)
who have spoken out. Yet tech workers across the industry have only grown more
united in pressuring Google and Amazon to drop Nimbus, and we are convinced
that we can succeed, as we did in [forcing Google to drop a prior defense
contract](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html),
Project Maven, in 2018.

I can’t stay silent like our leadership has, and I want to honor the values
that our leaders won’t. Please join me in standing up against this genocide by
joining the No Tech for Apartheid campaign (www.notechforapartheid.com), which
is working to ensure our company and our industry is not complicit. They will
be holding a mass call on [INSERT NEXT CALL], for which you can register at
[bit.ly/NOTACallToAction](https://bit.ly/NOTACallToAction), which also has
other actions you can take.

And finally, thank you for hearing me out and understanding that so many of us
are trying to find where we can use our voice for peace - I hope you will too.

Sincerely / In solidarity, [YOUR NAME]
