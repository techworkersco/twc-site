6pm - 8pm at The Sycamore in San Francisco (2140 Mission St, San Francisco)

Our next Bay Area meetup is coming up - join us at The Sycamore in San 
Francisco for a casual hang with fellow tech workers. We'll be hanging 
out in the back, a few blocks from 16th Mission BART. It’s a chance to 
meet other tech comrades, commiserate, and get plugged into TWC Bay 
Area. 

All are welcome!
