Join Tech Workers Coalition for a continuation of our organizing skills 
workshop series!

Structured organizing conversations are a core skill for any organizer, 
whether forming a union or building community power. Come attend this 
two hour workshop where we'll learn the parts of an organizing 
conversation, practice using these skills in small groups, and get to 
know other tech workers who are also learning alongside. Participating 
in Part 1 is not required to attend this workshop.

[Zoom registration](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/NyBDxJ_fRxGoRzFHOYKAoA) is required.
