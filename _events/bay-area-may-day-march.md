May 1st, or May Day, is International Labor Day, commemorating a long history of workers’ resistance and building labor power. TWC is joining a broad coalition of unions and community organizations in a historic drive nationwide to march on May Day, and build a movement fighting back against the billionaire agenda!

In the face of escalated repression, attacks on immigrant workers, and the rise of the tech oligarchy, it is critical for tech workers to show up in solidarity with workers and communities in the Bay Area and around the world.

We will be participating in the march starting at **SF Civic Center on May 1 at 4:00 PM**. We hope you can join us!

To be added to May Day comms find us in [\#local-bay-area](https://techworkersco.slack.com/archives/C805F5JA3) channel in Slack or email hello@techworkerscoalition.org
