Labor organizers must work to keep our movements sustainable. How do we shift conflict from a destructive to generative force in our organizing spaces? How do we properly care for each other in difficult times? In this session, we will explore these questions and seek to provide answers while promoting a culture of honesty, vulnerability, and self-awareness.

**Join us for this workshop, first debuted at Circuit Breakers 2025**
