In this virtual workshop, we'll explore examples of previous campaigns and actions within larger social movements and examine what made them successful (or not). We'll learn how to ask the right questions to understand a political landscape; assess our personal risk & resources in campaign organizing and direct action; and practice building a mock campaign from scratch, using a strategy tool created by organizers in the midwest.

Note: this workshop focuses primarily on campaign organizing — not labor organizing but skills and tools definitely overlap. We encourage you to join if you’ve never been a part of a campaign before.
