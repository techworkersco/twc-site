Tech Worker Coalitionâ€™s first onboarding calls of the year! ðŸ’¥ If you work in the tech industry and are looking a place to build power, find community, and learn new skills, come get active with TWC.


There will be two identical calls on Monday, Feb. 17th to accommodate different timezones â€” so make sure to register for the right link!


Option A will take place at **18:00 CEST / 12:00 PM ET / 9:00 AM PT**, and you can register at <a href="https://bit.ly/twc101-feb2025A">bit.ly/twc101-feb2025A</a>. 


Option B will take place at **5:00 PM PT / 8:00 PM ET**, and you can register at <a href="https://bit.ly/twc101-feb2025B">bit.ly/twc101-feb2025B</a>.


We will go over the history of TWC, the structure of our chapters, what projects weâ€™re currently up to, and ways that you can help us make them a success! We especially are looking to onboard leaders who can help us build infrastructure to absorb even more folks. See you then! ðŸ’«
