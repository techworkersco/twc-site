Tech Workers Coalition & No Tech For Apartheid present a panel discussion and community forum: Tech Against Totalitarianism. Join Google workers who were fired for protesting, along with organizers in the movement against apartheid & totalitarianism, to reflect on one year since the sit-ins and how to meet the current moment. Tech fascism is officially unmasked – now more than ever, it’s time to learn from and support one another.

📍 1499 Fruitvale Avenue, Oakland
⏰ 5:00 - 7:00 PM
