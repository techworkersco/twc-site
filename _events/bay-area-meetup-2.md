Our next Bay Area meetup is coming up - join us at Arthur Mac's in Oakland for a casual hang with fellow tech workers. We'll be hanging out on the patio, just a block from MacArthur BART. It’s a chance to meet other tech comrades, commiserate, and get plugged into TWC Bay Area. All are welcome!

📆 Thursday, August 7th, 2025\
⏰ 6:00-800 PM\
📍 Arthur Mac’s (4006 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland)
