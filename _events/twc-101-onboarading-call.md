We’ll have two onboarding calls for anyone who wants to learn more about the Tech Workers Coalition & what you can do to get more involved. This is a great chance to hear about our projects, meet some cool people, and get plugged in, whether you’re new or have been lurking, or simply want a refresher.

We will have two sessions (both the same content) on Tuesday, April 15th to make it easier for timezones. Register now at [bit.ly/twc101-apr2025A](https://bit.ly/twc101-apr2025A) or [bit.ly/twc101-apr2025B](https://bit.ly/twc101-apr2025B) for your respective slot.
